Data files organized as follows:

Bernoulli task

1) stimuli: Folders (name: H<hazard rate>P<proportion black beads>) with .csv files that characterize the stimulus sequence in each task. Each .csv file has two columns: urn (1 or 2) and bead (1 or 2). Rows are trials.

2) subjects: .csv files containing raw data per subject, with column names at the top.

Gaussian task

1) Data_varR.dat: data from trials with fixed volatility (h), variable noise (R)

1) Data_varh.dat: data from trials with fixed noise (R), variable volatility (h)
